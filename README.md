# About the Project
A Website that was made with the help of HTML/CSS, Javascript, Jinja and Python (namely Flask).
The site showcases animations of the trigonometric functions (Inverse ones too) made with the help of the turtle module of Python and renders them as per the user's request on the site. 
The animations are rendered dynamically onto the webpage with the help of Skulpt.
Feel free to choose multiple options and mix and match to your heart's content.
